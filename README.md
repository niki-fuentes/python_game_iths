###################      DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT    ######################


#                  CREATE A ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS GAME 

# When the game starts, the user has to type one of the following options:
# rock, paper OR scissors 
# and press ENTER.

# The results will display on screen, letting the user know if they won,
# lost or if it was a draw. 
# A point will be added for every WIN. Draws give no points.
# A Round counter will be displayed at top of each game. 

# After every round, the user will have the option to continue the game
# by typing y/n (yes/no).

# NOTE TO PROFESSOR:
# Code is functioning, but could be written with less repetitive code. Working on that!
